# Welcome
Hello, I'm tye! I'm non-binary & go by they/them, thank you for being respectfull.

My favorite pastime is righting with computers, which *sometimes* goes smoothly. Well not really, it's more-so an
everconstant upwards battle against whatever devil decides to haunt these damn machines; But i digress.

When my computer *decides* it that it would actually like to work today i spend most of my free time coding, or
working on other computer-science/electronics related projects. Currently my favorite programming language is rust,
as i support the design philosipohy of the language & i find it a joy to use. (Fun fact, this website is compilled
from rust!).
